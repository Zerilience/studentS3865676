			<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			<p>I have loved video games for as long as I can remember. My earliest memories were of playing 'Fable: The Lost Chapters' on my cousin's computer. The eight-year-old me thought that it was the perfect game. Every year, stories told through IT in the form of video games are improving - whether it is graphics, motion capture or the narrative. I have hopes of joining the gaming industry in the future.</p> 
			<p>I have little experience in IT, however, I hope that my time in RMIT would provide me with the necessary knowledge to become an IT. I chose RMIT because it was recommended to me by a friend and a relative. Also, the user interface of their website appealed to me.</p>
