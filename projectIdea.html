			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>My project Idea is a 'Point-and-click' Sandbox RPG. It will be like an interactive novel and it would have RPG, Sandbox and management elements. You would be able to play the game cross-platform, meaning, you can play it on your mobile phone or computer. It would be like having a pet, but the pet is a character that you made in the game. You should be to play the game for either, hours in a sitting or just for five minutes when you find a little 'pocket' of time in your day.</p>
			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>My motivation is simple. I want to play a game like this. Also, I think that I am capable of making this game, or at least, I will be able to learn how to make it soon. Because it is text-based, it will require a great deal of 'story'. That is characters, plot and a great world setting. Luckily, I already have all of this. Furthermore, I know that there is a demand for RPGs as shown in this <a href="https://blog.roll20.net/post/143493281735/the-orr-group-industry-report-q1-2016">statistic</a>.</p>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The project is a game and it will be called, for now, 'Heroism' simply because the word sounds cool. In a nutshell, Heroism is a sandbox RPG. Sandbox meaning that there is no 'end-game' or an objective. The objective will be up to the player to choose from. And RPG, meaning, that the game would have the player assume a role. For instance, the player could be a bandit, a bounty hunter, a farmer peasant, or a local lord. </p>
			<p>Heroism has no world setting yet. But many come to mind. This could be a medieval-fantasy type world constantly at war. It could be a post-apocalyptic world where resources are scarce and the player would have to find a way to survive.</p>
			<p>The player would be presented with opportunities to be good or evil. In a nutshell, it would be like if someone had blended 'Skyrim', 'Crusader Kings', and 'Mount and Blade' into a single game. But the game would be point-and-click, sort of like a 'choose your own adventure' type game. </p>
			<p>Time will be a big focus of Heroism. The player will spend most of their time staring at a screen and waiting. For instance, the player decides that their character needs to go to 'town x', this will take half an in-game day, but it will take thirty-seconds out of the game, or faster, depending on the player's preference because they would be able to fast-forward the game. Now, half-way through their journey, they will encounter an enemy or perhaps someone who needs help. This will take time. And the player will be rewarded with resources. They would then need to manage their character, perhaps they were wounded, or they are thirsty or hungry. Maybe they obtained an item and they need to equip it. They would then need set camp for the night to begin the next day. All of this would have been five-minutes out of the game. Maybe the player will keep playing for another hour or maybe they will set their phone down and continue with their real life.</p>
			<p>From a technical standpoint, Heroism would need great atmospheric music. The music would be dynamic - meaning it would change based on what is happening in the game. Whether it's a relaxed moment at dusk or during a battle at dawn. Heroism would also need great background, object and character art and map design.</p>
			<p>The main driver of Heroism would have to be the story. This includes the dialogue, the hand-crafted scenarios and world-building.</p>
			<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. If you are going to work in a group you will need a repository to store your codes.</p>
			<p><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>. You need a place to communicate with your team.</p>
			<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a>. Being able to see your code live is handy. A fact I wish I knew at the beginning of this assignment instead of when I was 90% done.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.wonderdraft.net/">Wonderdraft</a>. A map maker tool.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.clipstudio.net/en/">Clip Studio Paint</a>. You need a software to make art.</p>
			<p><a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. Used to construct the game.</p>
			<h2>Skills Required</h2>
			<p>html, java script, unity, voice acting, music composing, writing, drawing. </p>
			<h2>Outcome</h2>
			<p>If the project is successful, then it would make me happy, which is the most important thing. I think happiness is direcly linked to success. And I think it would provide the users with an escape platform to relax in. The project will also spark creativity in others and perhaps inspire them to share with the world the most powerful form of story telling that is their imagination.</p>
